- arrays can be declared two different ways
    - int a [];
    - int [] a;
        - there is one difference between them;
        int a [], b, c;// just a is array
        int [] a, b, c;// all of them array;

- length of dizi can't be positive;
- if index is out of range arrays wil throw exception
- member variable that  name's length, you can get length of array
- you can't set length variable.
- reference of array can show different array in another time

- initialization rules
    - initialization to reference and array
        int [] a = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5};

    - initialization to array
        int [] a;
        a = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5};
    - when you initialize both of them you don't need to write new operator
        int [] a = {1,2,3,4,5};

- when you initalize to array we can put a comma at the end of the inialization list;
 int [] a  = new int[]{1 ,2 ,3, 4,};

- if you don't inialize to array you have to put length of array;
    int [] a;
    a = new int[]{1,2,3,4,5};
    a = new int[5];

- when  array is created, default value assigned to their member.

- reference arrays
  - when we create a reference array like
     Sample [] sArr = new Sample[10];
     - here we are not initalizing the references. we are just initializing the array.
       so if we try the sArr[i].x = 10; // this will be error. Because, s[i] object is
       not created.
     - we can only use after the sArr[i] = new Sample;
